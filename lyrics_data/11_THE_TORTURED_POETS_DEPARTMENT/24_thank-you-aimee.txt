[Verse 1]
When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs, at our school

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day, I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwing punches, I was building something
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky, as the blood was gushing
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight, or a clean kill
Each time that Aimee stomped across my grave
And then she wrote headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day, I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwing punches, I was building something
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky, as the blood was gushing
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Post-Chorus]
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head

[Verse 3]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy which you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this, if there hadn't been you

[Bridge]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singing
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause-

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwing punches, it was all for nothing
And our town, it looks so small, from way up here
Screamed "Thank you, Aimee" to the night sky, and the stars are stunning
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Post-Chorus]
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head

[Outro]
Thank you, Aimee
Thank you, Aimee

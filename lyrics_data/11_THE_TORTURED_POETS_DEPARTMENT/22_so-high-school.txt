THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT
So High School
[Intro]
I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you

[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinkling eye
I'm sinking, our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
Tell me about the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smoking your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Post-Chorus]
I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm trying to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you, but look at you

[Verse 1]
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me
It's just a game, but really
I'm betting on all three for us two
Get my car door, isn't that sweet?
Then pull me to the backseat
No one's ever had me, not like you

[Bridge]
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, Scout's honor
You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe$<misc_bad end of bridge>

[Verse 2]
I feel like laughing in the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I'm hearing voices like a madman

[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinkling eye
I'm sinking, our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
Tell me about the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smoking your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Post-Chorus]
I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm trying to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you, but look at you

[Bridge]
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Teach me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, Scout's honor
You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe$<misc_bad end of bridge>
You already know, babe$<misc_bad end of bridge>

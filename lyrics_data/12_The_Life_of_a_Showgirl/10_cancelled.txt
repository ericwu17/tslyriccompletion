The Life of a Showgirl
CANCELLED!
[Verse 1]
You thought that it would be okay, at first
The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse
Beware the wrath of masked crusaders

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you girlboss too close to the sun?
Did they catch you having far too much fun?
Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
Something wicked this way comes

[Chorus]
Good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour, and poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars

[Verse 2]
It's easy to love you when you're popular
The optics click, everyone prospers
But one single drop, you're off the roster
"Tone-deaf and hot, let's fucking off her"

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you make a joke only a man could?
Were you just too smug for your own good?
Or bring a tiny violin to a knife fight?
Baby, that all ends tonight

[Chorus]
Good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour, and poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld, it'll break your heart
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars

[Bridge]
They stood by me before my exoneration
They believed I was innocent
So I'm not here for judgment, no

[Verse 3]
But if you can't be good, then just be better at it
Everyone's got bodies in the attic
Or took somebody's man, we'll take you by the hand
And soon you'll learn the art of never getting caught

[Chorus]
It's a good thing I like my friends cancelled
You know that I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour, and poison thorny flowers
Yeah, it's a good thing I like my friends cancelled
I salute you if you're much too much to handle
Like my whiskey sour, and poison thorny flowers
Can't you see my infamy loves company?
Now they've broken you like they've broken me
But a shattered glass is a lot more sharp
And now you know exactly who your friends are
We're the ones with matching scars

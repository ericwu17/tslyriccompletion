The Life of a Showgirl
Eldest Daughter
[Verse 1]
Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy that was a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool

[Chorus]
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Verse 2]
You know, the last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage that was a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter
So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire

[Chorus]
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Bridge]
We lie back
A beautiful, beautiful time-lapse
Ferris wheels, kisses, and lilacs
And things I said were dumb
'Cause I thought that I'd never find that
Beautiful, beautiful life that
Shimmers that innocent light back
Like when we were young

[Pre-Chorus]
Every youngest child felt
They were raised up in the wild
But now you're home

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
And I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Outro]
Never gonna break that vow$<misc_bad outro>
I'm never gonna leave you now, now$<misc_bad outro>
I'm never gonna leave you now$<misc_bad outro>

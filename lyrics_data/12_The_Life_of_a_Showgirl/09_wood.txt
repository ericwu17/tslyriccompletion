The Life of a Showgirl
Wood
[Verse 1]
Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not, he loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood

[Chorus]
All of that bitching, wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood

[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my thighs


[Verse 2]
Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet
To know a hard rock is on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
The curse on me was broken by your magic wand
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
New Heights of manhood, I ain't gotta knock on wood

[Chorus]
All of that bitching, wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood

[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my thighs
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my thighs

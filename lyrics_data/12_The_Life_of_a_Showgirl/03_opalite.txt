The Life of a Showgirl
Opalite
[Verse 1]
I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong$<misc_bad end of pre-chorus>

[Chorus]
But my mama told me, It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord, never made no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You couldn't understand it
Why you felt alone
You were in it for real
She was in her phone
And you were just a pose
And don't we try to love love?
We give it all we got
You finally left the table
And what a simple thought
You're starving 'til you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have messed up before, they'll mess up again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
You move on$<misc_bad end of pre-chorus>

[Chorus]
And that's when I told you, It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord, never made no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
This is just a storm inside a teacup
But shelter here with me, my love
Thunder like a drum, this life will beat you up, up, up, up
This is just a temporary speed bump
But failure brings you freedom
And I can bring you love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
Don't you sweat it, baby, it's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord, never made no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

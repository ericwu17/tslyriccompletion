The Life of a Showgirl
Father Figure
[Verse 1]
When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag, turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me,"
I saw potential$<misc_bad end of verse 1>

[Chorus]
I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve

[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family

[Verse 2]
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty
my dear protégé$<misc_bad end of verse 2>

[Chorus]
I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family

[Bridge]
I saw a change in you my dear boy
They don't make loyalty like they used to
Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
On foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions
That to fulfill your dreams
You had to get rid of me
I protect the family$<misc_bad end of bridge>

[Chorus]
I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor
You made a deal with this devil, turns out my dick's bigger
You want a fight? You found it, I got the place surrounded
You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning
Whose portrait's on the mantel? Who covered up your scandals?
Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled
I was your father figure, you pulled the wrong trigger
This empire belongs to me

[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me$<misc_bad end of post-chorus>

[Outro]
"You know, you remind me of a younger me"
I saw potential

The Life of a Showgirl
The Fate of Ophelia
[Verse 1]
I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me, myself, and I
Right before you lit my sky up

[Chorus]
All that time I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night you dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land, the sea, the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been, 'cause now, you're mine
It's about to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia$<misc_bad confusable with other lines>

[Verse 2]
The eldest daughter of a nobleman
Ophelia lived in fantasy
But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
The venom stole her sanity

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've lingered in purgatory
You wrap around me like a chain, a crown, a vine
Pulling me into the fire

[Chorus]
All that time I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night you dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land, the sea, the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been, 'cause now, you're mine
It's about to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia$<misc_bad confusable with other lines>

[Bridge]
'Tis locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me
Locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me

[Chorus]
All that time I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night you dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land, the sea, the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been, 'cause now, you're mine
It's about to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia$<misc_bad confusable with other lines>

[Outro]
You saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia

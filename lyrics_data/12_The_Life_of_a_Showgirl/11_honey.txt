The Life of a Showgirl
Honey
[Intro]
You can call me "honey" if you want because I'm the one you want$<misc_bad intro>

[Chorus]
When anyone called me "sweetheart"
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me "honey"
It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home

[Post-Chorus]
But you touched my face
Redefined all of those blues when you say "honey"$<misc_bad end of post-chorus>

[Verse 1]
Summertime spritz, pink skies
You can call me "honey" if you want because I'm the one you want
Wintergreen kiss, all mine
You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
Honey, I'm home, we could play house
We can bed down, pick me up
Who's the baddest in the land? What's the plan?
You could be my forever-night stand, honey$<misc_bad end of verse>

[Chorus]
When anyone called me "sweetheart"
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me "honey"
It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home

[Post-Chorus]
But you touched my face
Redefined all of those blues when you say$<misc_bad end of post-chorus>

[Verse 2]
You can call me "honey" if you want because I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
Sweetie, it's yours, kicking in doors
Take it to the floor, give me more
Buy the paint in the color of your eyes
And graffiti my whole damn life, honey$<misc_bad end of verse>

[Pre-Chorus]
When anyone called me late night
He was screwing around with my mind
Asking, "What are you wearing?", too high
To remember in the morning
And when anyone called me "lovely"
They were finding ways not to praise me
But you say it like you're in awe of me
And you stay until the morning$<misc_bad end of pre-chorus>
Honey$<misc_bad end of pre-chorus>

[Chorus]
When anyone called me "sweetheart"
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me "honey"
It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home

[Outro]
But you can call me "honey" if you want

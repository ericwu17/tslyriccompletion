The Life of a Showgirl
Wi$h Li$t
[Verse 1]
They want that yacht life, under chopper blades
They want those bright lights and Balenci' shades
And a fat ass with a baby face
They want it all
They want that complex female character
They want that critical smash Palme d'Or
And an Oscar on their bathroom floor
They want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
Hope they get what they want

[Chorus]
I just want you
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming about a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish list
I just want you

[Verse 2]
They want that freedom, living off the grid
They want those three dogs that they call their kids
And that good surf, no hypocrites
They want it all
They want a contract with Real Madrid
They want that spring break that was fucking lit
And then that video taken off the internet
They want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
I hope they get what they want

[Chorus]
I just want you
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming about a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish list

[Bridge]
I made wishes on all of the stars
Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot
I thought I had it right, once, twice, but I did not
You caught me off my guard
I hope I get what I want
'Cause I know what I want

[Chorus]
I just want you
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming about a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish list
I just want you
And we could have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming about a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish list
I just want you

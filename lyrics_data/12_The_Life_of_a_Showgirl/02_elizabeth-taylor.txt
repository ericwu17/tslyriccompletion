[Intro]
Elizabeth Taylor$<misc_bad Intro>
Do you think it's forever?$<misc_bad Intro>

[Verse 1]
That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée 
Ooh-ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me
All the right guys promised they'd stay
Under bright lights, they withered away
But you bloom, Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if your letters ever said, "Goodbye"

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you

[Verse 2]
He, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?
Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust, just kidding
We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank's
They say I'm bad news, I just say, "Thanks"
And you look at me like you're hypnotized, and I think you know why

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ever leave me high and dry

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you

[Bridge]
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
Don't you ever end up anything but mine

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you
[Outro]
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
Don't you ever end up anything but mine
